# code-refactory-hw
This HW assignment was to look at the mock website and coding to clean it up. I kept track of a list of items that I changed.

1) Updated <title> tag with company name of Horiseon.

2) Added id="search-engine-optimization" to reference other id's from the three nav bar links to have the page jump to the appropriate sections.

3) Added alt descriptions to all images in content section and benefits section. I did not add an alt description the the image below header that was incorporated with the CSS. It did not seem to accept the alt element on the CSS like it does on the html file.

4) On the CSS, I changed all areas where the blue was not #0072bb to that hex color code to match all shades of blue.

5) On CSS, I changed the online-reputation-management image to float-left so all images align on the left side instead of them being on the right side.

6) Updated <div> tags to more specific tags such as <header> and <section>. I left some <div> tags because I didn't know what else to use when containing an image for example.

7) On CSS, I removed a class named float-right because I made the images all float-left from #5 above.

8) For class .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit cost, I center aligned text on the CSS.

9) I removed extra .benefit-leat, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost h3 classes because it seemed to be extra classes that wasn't necessary.

Items I tried but couldn't quite get to function:

1) I tried to make the three sections within the content class to line up with the bottom edge of the benefits class by putting extra padding to 55px to .online-reputation-management and 
.social-media-marketing classes but couldn't quite get them to line up perfectly.

2) I tried to combine the 3 classes of search-engine, social-media, and online-reputation that were repeating to 1 class and rename it but when I adjusted it, the 3 images enlarged and took over the whole page. Then I had difficulty figuring out where to readjust the images back to their original size.
